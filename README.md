# Javascript Challenge:

## This repository contains the folders and files regarding a javascript exercise that was performed with data related to UFO sightings.

We were given a dataset regarding UFO sightings.
The dataset contained the following columns:
* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape
* Duration
* Comments

We were asked to build a webpage that would display the data dynamically in a table, and then also allow users to query the data based on certain criteria.

There are 2 folders in this repository:
1.	UFO-level 1: 
This folder contains the following
* Index.html file – this is used for the webpage. 
This allows the user to query only by the date of the UFO sighting.
* Folder called “static”. This folder contains the following:
  * Folder called “css” that contains the CSS file used by the HTML file.
  * Folder called “images” that contains the images used by the HTML file.
  * Folder called “js” which contains the javascript file used by the HTML file.
